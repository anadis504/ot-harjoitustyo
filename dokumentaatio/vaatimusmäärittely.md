# Snake-game

The purpose of this project is to create the classic snake-game desctop application: a single-player computer game where the player manouvers a growing line (snake) moving on the screen.
The program is to be written in Java with Maven. GUI is to be implemented using JavaFX.

## User roles
There will be only one user role and no need for signing in to the program. 

## Primary features
* Snake line moves constantly forward.
* User controlles the snake line on the screen using arrow keys.
* Snake grows by eating objects on the screen.
* Speed of snake may be increasing.
* Points are given by feeding the snake.
* Game is over when snake crashes in in the frame or own body.
* When achieving new highscores the player will be asked for a player name in order to keep track of the high-scores. 
* Scores will be stored locally. 
* User may review the score statistics from GUI.

### Additional features
* The player may choose between different frames:
  * Full frame
  * No frame, snake appears on the opposite side of the screen when hitting the frame.
  * Partly framed, different obstacles.
