# Architecture

## Architecture structure

The application has a three-layer architecture and the package structure is as follows

Package snakegame.ui contains user interface implemented with javaFX. Package snakegame.domain contains the application logic and package snakegame.dao contains reading and writing to permanent memory logic.

## User Interface

Package snakegame.ui consists of three classes:
* Ui
* ScoreScene
* GameScene

Class Ui contains the start([Stage](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/stage/Stage.html) primaryStage) method that is launched from the _main_ method when the program starts.

User interface contains three different scenes:

* Main menu scene
* Score liste√≠ng scene
* Game scene

( The User Interface is to see some refactoring, propper description to be continued )

Question: Should I put all the ui code into one class like OtmTodoApp program? It will make the class very long, but make some things easier I guess... Appart from Ohjelmoinnin jatkokurssi this is my first time with javaFX.
