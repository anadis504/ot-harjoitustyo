Package snakegame.ui contains user interface implemented with javaFX. Package snakegame.domain contains the application logic and package snakegame.dao contains reading and writing to permanent memory logic.

## User Interface

User interface contains three different scenes:

* Main menu scene
* Score liste√≠ng scene
* Game scene

( The User Interface is to see some refactoring, propper description to be continued )
